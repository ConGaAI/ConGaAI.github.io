# Connection

Public guide: [GitHub · Connection](https://github.com/ConGaAI/AI-Forge/blob/main/docs/en/connection.md)

Three parts: **identity → connect → key**. The step row on the page shows which parts are done. Finish them in order. Connection and authorization happen on this screen.

## Username

Enter the name your admin assigned, then **Save**. That is this computer’s identity on the channel.

## Authorize

![Authorize](/assets/ai-forge/authorize.png)

**Authorize** shows this computer’s authorization key. Click **Copy key**. Do not select the shortened text on screen. Send the full line to an admin, then **Connect**.

## Connect button

| Status | What to do |
|---|---|
| Disconnected | Save the name, finish authorization, then connect |
| Connecting / reconnecting | Wait; it retries on a flaky network |
| Connected | You can paste the service key |
| Unauthorized | Ask the admin to allow this computer |
| Remote unreachable | Check the network, then Retry |
| Server verification failed | Contact an admin; do not ignore this |

**Disconnect** if you need to leave for a while.

## Service key

You can verify only after connect succeeds. Paste the key, then **Save and verify**. The page shows whether conversation and document understanding work, and the vector size used on import (you do not type that).

Paste it only here. The window passes it into assistants it launches.

If a key is already stored, use **Verify again**.
